# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/logo/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/on_boarding_screen/
    - assets/avaters/
    - assets/Backgrounds/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a

  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Intel
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/Fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
